    </h1>
    <h2>Dear Eileen,</h2>

<p>

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at <a href="http://example.com.">Université Génialissime</a> to <br>
study for your PhD next year.
I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
</p>
<h2>Start dates</h2>

<p>
    We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the
    <br>beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>First semester: September 9, 2016</li>
<li>Second semester: January 15, 2017</li>
<li>Third semester: May 2, 2017</li>
    </ul>
  
 Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer.
 <br>You can find more information about important university dates on our  <a href="http://example.com.">website</a>.
  
</p>
<h2>Study subjects</h2>
<p>

In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall 
<br>within the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the 
<br>kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the ones 
<br>that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:
</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), when 
    <br>audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
    <li>Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the
<br>research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,
<br>
Eleanor Gaye
